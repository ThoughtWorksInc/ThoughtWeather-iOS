## The Brief
### We'll replace this with a proper README soon :)
Regarding the project of the 5th day, I was thinking of the cliche weather app.
We will need to prepare a project that will have a single view that calls an API and displays the weather for a specific area + a transition to another screen that has the app version or something basic.

Then we would ask them to achieve the following:
-Show in a list the upcoming 5 days. (Add API, tableview, MVVM).
-Make a details screen of a specific day where more info will be seen, autolayout should be used with constraints.
-Find an API that takes data, and make them submit the info to an API (POST request), for example an API that shares the weather to an email.
